Feature: Login functionality for OpenCart

  As a registered user
  I want to be able to log in using my email and password
  So that I can access my account dashboard

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given I am on the OpenCart login page
    When I enter a valid email and password
    And I click the "Login" button
    Then I should be redirected to my account dashboard
    And I should see a welcome message with my name

  Scenario: Login attempt with invalid password
    Given I am on the OpenCart login page
    When I enter a valid email but an invalid password
    And I click the "Login" button
    Then I should see an error message saying "Warning: No match for E-Mail Address and/or Password."

  Scenario: Login attempt with empty fields
    Given I am on the OpenCart login page
    When I leave the email and password fields empty
    And I click the "Login" button
    Then I should see a validation message asking to enter credentials
